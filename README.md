# Probe Detection Using YOLO

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning pipeline using YOLO to detect ultrasonic thickness measurement probes in drone images. The system identifies bounding boxes around probes and notifies if no probe is detected.

## Features
- **Data Handling:** Automated splitting of dataset into train, validation, and test sets.
- **YOLO Integration:** Fine-tuned YOLOv8 model for probe detection.
- **Visualization:** Qualitative evaluation using example outputs.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of:
- `probe_images/`: Folder containing raw images.
- `probe_labels.json`: JSON file containing bounding box annotations.

## Example Output
**Input Image:**
![Input Image](probe_dataset/probe_images/E300PREMP00002_00725_216_1flight_11100_2.jpg)

**Output with Detected Probe:**
![Detected Probe](runs/detect/predict/E300PREMP00002_00725_216_1flight_11100_2.jpg)

### 4. **Uploading to GitHub**
1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Push your project:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit for probe detection project"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/probe-detection-yolo.git
   git push -u origin main
By following these steps, your README will be visually rich, easy to understand, and the submission will meet the required standards.
